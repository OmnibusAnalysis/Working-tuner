            <p>
              Working Tuner uses the Web Audio API to generate precise reference tones and analyze audio input from your
              microphone. The pitch detection algorithm uses autocorrelation to identify the fundamental frequency of
              played notes, which is then compared to the expected frequencies for your selected instrument and tuning.

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-zinc-100 mt-8">Privacy</h2>
            <p>
              Working Tuner respects your privacy. When you use the microphone feature, all audio processing happens directly
              in your browser. No audio data is ever sent to our servers or stored anywhere. The microphone is only used
              for pitch detection and is automatically disconnected when you stop the microphone or leave the page.
